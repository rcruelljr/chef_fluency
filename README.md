Chef examples and notes as I work through Udemy and LinuxAcademy courses

## Why Chef?

I LOVE to cook!

Why does that matter? Chef is known to have a significant learning curve. I believe my familiarity with (faux) culinary arts has reduced that curve significantly. Think about, cookbooks contain recipes and recipes contain ingredients (resources), that's a good chunk of Chef knowledge already!

Chef is currently on the short list of a long list of TODOs. As a QA professional, my work does not stop at the click of a button. QA is philosophy, not a position. I aim to mold myself into a rare gem, focused on Automation and Security.

## What's contained in this repository?

This repository mostly contains exercises related to the Chef approved courses I'm working my way through on Udemy and Linux Academy (great resources!). This is the most recent of my repositories, the others being examples of Test Automation.

In addition to exercises, you'll also find my notes. Let these be a reference to how I perceive Chef (and problems in general), as well as, a sample of written communication.
